# 0x19. Postmortem
### Issue Summary
* Duration of the outage: 2 hours (June 15, 2023, 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM GMT)
* Impact: The web server experienced slow response times and intermittent service disruptions, affecting 100% of users.
* Root cause: A misconfiguration in the web server's settings caused the issue.
### Timeline
* The issue was detected at 10:02 AM GMT when users started reporting slow load times and service interruptions.
* The issue was identified at 10:15 AM GMT after monitoring alerts and investigating the web server logs.
* The web server's configuration files were reviewed, and the root cause was identified at 10:40 AM GMT.
* The issue was escalated to the web server team at 11:00 AM GMT.
* The web server was restarted at 11:15 AM GMT, resolving the issue and restoring normal service.
### Root cause and resolution
The web server's configuration files had a typo in the settings, causing the server to misbehave and respond slowly. The web server was restarted to clear the configuration files and resolve the issue.
### Corrective and preventative measures
* Improve the web server's configuration validation process to catch such issues before they impact users.
* Add monitoring alerts for slow response times and service disruptions to detect issues earlier.
* Implement a rolling restart process for the web server to minimize the impact of configuration changes.
> In this hypothetical postmortem, the issue was caused by a simple configuration error, which led to slow response times and intermittent service disruptions. The issue was detected and resolved quickly, with minimal impact on users. To prevent similar issues in the future, the team should improve their configuration validation process, add monitoring alerts, and implement a rolling restart process for the web server.

# Humor
To lighten the mood and make the postmortem more engaging, here's a funny anecdote:
"During the outage, our CEO asked, 'Why is the web server running so slow?' To which our CTO responded, 'Well, you know, Mr. CEO, it's like a car with a flat tire. You can't go fast when you've got a flat tire!'"
